This repository contains the code and files for the Classroom Flu Spread Project. The project focuses on simulating an epidemic within a classroom setting and exploring the dynamics of disease transmission among children. Below is a brief description of each file:

- **Classrom Flu Spread Project.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with a detailed walkthrough of the project. It includes the code and explanations necessary to understand the simulation. The notebook allows for different settings of the simulation to be explored and adjusted. Final results and conclusions are not explained and can be found in the final pdf report.

- **Classrom Flu Spread Project.html**: A webpage version of the notebook but with the results and outputs already executed and displayed. It has the results from my runs that I used to write up the final report and can be useful for quickly checking values and examining plots.

- **Classrom Flu Spread Project - Final Report.pdf** - A final report with detailed findings and results. It can be useful in combination with the notebook to understand the full project.

- **sim_funcs.py**: Contains all the main functions used to run the simulations. It uses various libraries and provides the necessary logic and calculations for simulating the flu outbreak within the classroom.

- **plot_helper.py**: Contains all the plotting functions used to visualize histograms and evolution plots. It uses a combination of Bokeh and Matplotlib libraries to make visual representations of the simulation results.

- **4 dst files**: These files are used in the Arena input analyzer and are not important for understanding the project.
